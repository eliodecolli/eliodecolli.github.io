<p>This project was a fun task I had to do on my spare time to learn more about the CQRS pattern and event sourcing. The real fun part was learning about RabbitMQ, data-consistency strategies as well as implementing my own in-memory cache solution.</p>

<p>What really surprised me, is that when I first heard about CQRS it made little to no sense in my mind as to why this kind of pattern is considered useful. However, as I went along with this project I started to see its importance, especially in a microservice architecture. I think thereâ€™s still a lot of room for improvements, and a lot of things can be (re)done in a different and perhaps claner way. :)</p>

<p>I try to keep it updated as much as possible, by adding and improving architectural and design patterns, as well as functionalities.</p>

<p>To-Do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean up the project</li>
  <li>Add more documentation</li>
  <li>Implement a basic saga-pattern for data consistency</li>
  <li>Review the overall architecture implementation</li>
</ul>
